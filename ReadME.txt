Welcome to the recipe management application, the app here is called Recipe Haven. 

Main menu:
1. Add new recipe 
2. Show saved recipes
3. Change recipe scale  
4. Reset recipe Quantities

6. Close

When adding a new recipe, the user will be prompted for:
Number of ingredients  
Ingredient name
Ingredient amount
Measurement unit
Number of steps
Step details
The recipe will then be saved.

When showing saved recipes, previously entered recipes will be displayed. If no recipes exist, a message will indicate to first add a recipe.

When changing recipe scale, the user will select a scaling factor of 0.5 (half), 2 (double) or 3 (triple) to rescale the amounts. The scaled recipe will then display along with a confirmation message. 

Resetting recipe Quantities will return any adjusted amounts back to their original values.

Removing all saved recipes will remove all previously saved recipe data from the database.

The main menu will then re-display for the user to select another option or quit the application.
