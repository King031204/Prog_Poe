Welcome to the recipe management application, the app here is called Recipe Haven. 

Main menu:
1. Add new recipe 
2. View saved recipes
3. Adjust recipe sizes  
4. Reset recipe sizes
5. Delete all recipes
6. Quit application

When adding a new recipe, the user will be prompted for:
Recipe name
Number of ingredients  
Ingredient name
Ingredient amount
Measurement unit
Number of steps
Step details
The recipe will then be saved.

When viewing saved recipes, previously entered recipes will be displayed. If no recipes exist, a message will indicate to first add a recipe.

When adjusting recipe sizes, the user will select a scaling factor of 0.5 (half), 2 (double) or 3 (triple) to resize the amounts. The scaled recipe will then display along with a confirmation message. 

Resetting recipe sizes will return any adjusted amounts back to their original values.

Deleting all recipes will remove all previously saved recipe data from the database.

The main menu will then re-display for the user to select another option or quit the application. The text structure and workflow remains unchanged while rephrasing for clarity and professional tone.ï»¿
